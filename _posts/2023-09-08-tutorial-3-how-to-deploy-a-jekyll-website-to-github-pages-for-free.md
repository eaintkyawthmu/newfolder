## Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

The first step is to create a new GitHub repository for your Jekyll theme. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to your GitHub account and click on the **+** icon in the top right corner of the page.

5. Check the **Initialize this repository with a README** checkbox.
6. Click on the **Create repository** button.

## Step 2: Commit Your Jekyll Theme

The next step is to commit your Jekyll theme to the GitHub repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu machine.
2. Change to the directory where your Jekyll theme is located:
    
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/jekyll/theme
   ```
    
3. Initialize a new Git repository in the directory:
    
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    
4. Add the changes to the Git staging area:
    
    ```bash
    git add .
   ```
    
5. Commit the changes:
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
    
6. Push the changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy Your Jekyll Theme to GitHub Pages

The final step is to deploy your Jekyll theme to GitHub Pages. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to your GitHub repository and click on the **Settings** tab.
2. Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. Click **Pages**
3. Under Build and deployment, click the source and choose **GitHub Actions(Beta).**
4. Configure **GitHub Pages Jekyll.**
5. You donâ€™t have to write anything. Just click **Commit Changes.**
6. Wait a few seconds while GitHub Pages deploys your Jekyll website.
7. Click **Actions** and you can see the build and deploy process.
8. After success, you can now use your fully functional website hosted on GitHub Pages at no cost.

Note: GitHub Actions will create a `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your Jekyll repository automatically. This file should include the necessary steps to build and deploy your website, such as installing dependencies, building the site, and pushing it to GitHub Pages.
